# openai-python

This repository demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API with Python. It includes scripts and examples for generating text, images, and performing other tasks using models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and DALLÂ·E.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install openai
  pip install python-dotenv
  ```
- Set an environment variable with your ```OPENAI_API_KEY```. I did it with ```.env``` file ([tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-and-use-env-files-in-python/))
